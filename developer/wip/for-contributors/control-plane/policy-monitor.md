# The Policy Monitor

Some transfer types, once accepted by the `provider`, never reach the `COMPLETED` state. Streaming and HTTP transfers in consumer pull scenario are examples of this. In those scenarios the transfer will remain active (`STARTED`) until it gets terminated either manually by using the transfer processes [management API](./entities.md#7-transfer-processes), or automatically by the policy monitor, if it has been configured in the EDC runtime.

The policy monitor (`PolicyMonitorManager`) is a component that watches over on-going transfers on the provider side and ensures that the associated policies are still valid. The default implementation of the policy monitor is built on top of the [EDC state machine](./programming-primitives.md#1-state-machines) and tracks the monitored transfer processes in it's own entity `PolicyMonitorEntry` stored in the `PolicyMonitorStore`.

Once a transfer process transition to the `STARTED` state on the provider side, the policy monitor gets notified through the [eventing system](./service-layers.md#6-events-and-callbacks) of EDC and start tracking transfer process. For each monitored transfer process in the `STARTED` state the policy monitor retrieves the policy associated (through [contract agreement](./entities.md#5-contract-agreements)) and runs the [Policy Engine](./entities.md#22-policy-scopes-and-bindings) using the `policy.monitor` as scope. 
If the policy is no longer valid, the policy monitor marks the transfer process for termination (`TERMINATING`) and it will stop tracking it. 

The data plane also gets notified through the [data plane signaling](../contributor-handbook.md#210-data-plane-signaling) protocol about the termination of the transfer process, and if accepted by the data plane, the data transfer terminates as well.

## Note for implementors

Implementors that want a [Policy functions](./entities.md#23-policy-evaluation-functions) to be evaluated at the policy monitor layer need to bind such function in the `policy.monitor` scope.

Since the policy evaluation happens in background, the `PolicyContext` does not contain `ParticipantAgent` as context data. 

Currently the only information published in the `PolicyContext` available for functions in the `policy.monitor` scope are the [`ContractAgreement`](./entities.md#5-contract-agreements), and the `Instant` at the time of the evaluation.

A bundled example of a [Policy function](./entities.md#23-policy-evaluation-functions) that runs in the `policy.monitor` scope is the `ContractExpiryCheckFunction` which checks if the [contract agreement](./entities.md#5-contract-agreements) is not expired.
