## 1. Assets

Assets are containers for metadata, they do **not** contain the actual bits and bytes. Say you want to offer a file to
the dataspace, that is physically located in an S3 bucket, then the corresponding `Asset` would contain metadata about
it, such as the content type, file size, etc. In addition, it could contain _private_ properties, for when you want to
store properties on the asset, which you _do not want to_ expose to the dataspace. Private properties will get ignored
when serializing assets out over DSP.

A very simplistic `Asset` could look like this:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/"
  },
  "@id": "79d9c360-476b-47e8-8925-0ffbeba5aec2",
  "properties": {
    "somePublicProp": "a very interesting value"
  },
  "privateProperties": {
    "secretKey": "this is secret information, never tell it to the dataspace!"
  },
  "dataAddress": {
    "type": "HttpData",
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:8080/test"
  }
}
```

The `Asset` also contains a `DataAddress` object, which can be understood as a "pointer into the physical world". It
contains information about where the asset is physically located. This could be a HTTP URL, or a complex object. In the
S3 example, that `DataAddress` might contain the bucket name, region and potentially other information. Notice that the
_schema_ of the `DataAddress` will depend on where the data is physically located, for instance a `HttpDataAddress` has
different properties from an S3 `DataAddress`. More precisely, Assets and DataAddresses are _schemaless_, so there is no
schema enforcement beyond a very basic validation. Read [this document](./service-layers.md) to learn about plugging in
custom validators.

A few things must be noted. First, while there isn't a _strict requirement_ for the `@id` to be a UUID, we highly
recommend using the JDK `UUID` implementation.

Second, _never_ store access credentials such as passwords, tokens, keys etc. in the `dataAddress` or even the
`privateProperties` object. While the latter does not get serialized over DSP, both properties are persisted in the
database. Always use a HSM to store the credential, and hold a reference to the secret in the DataAddress. Checkout
[the best practices](../contributor-handbook.md#4-development-best-practices) for details.

By design, Assets are extensible, so users can store any metadata they want in it. For example, the `properties` object
could contain a simple string value, or it could be a complex object, following some custom schema. Be aware, that
unless specified otherwise, all properties are put under the `edc` namespace by default. There are some "well-known"
properties in the `edc` namespace: `id`, `description`, `version`, `name`, `contenttype`.

Here is an example of how an Asset with a custom property following a custom namespace would look like:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/",
    "sw": "http://w3id.org/starwars/v0.0.1/ns/"
  },
  "@id": "79d9c360-476b-47e8-8925-0ffbeba5aec2",
  "properties": {
    "faction": "Galactic Imperium",
    "person": {
      "name": "Darth Vader",
      "webpage": "https://death.star"
    }
  }
}
```

(assuming the `sw` context contains appropriate definitions for `faction` and `person`).

Remember that upon ingress through the Management API, all JSON-LD objects get
[expanded](https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#expanded-document-form), and the control plane only operates on expanded
JSON-LD objects. The Asset above would look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "@id": "79d9c360-476b-47e8-8925-0ffbeba5aec2",
    "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/properties": [
      {
        "https://w3id.org/starwars/v0.0.1/ns/faction": [
          {
            "@value": "Galactic Imperium"
          }
        ],
        "http://w3id.org/starwars/v0.0.1/ns/person": [
          {
            "http://w3id.org/starwars/v0.0.1/ns/name": [
              {
                "@value": "Darth Vader"
              }
            ],
            "http://w3id.org/starwars/v0.0.1/ns/webpage": [
              {
                "@value": "https://death.star"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

This is important to keep in mind, because it means that Assets get persisted in their expanded form, and operations
performed on them (e.g. querying) in the control plane must also be done on the expanded form. For example, a query
targeting the `sw:faction` field from the example above would look like this:

```json
{
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/filterExpression": [
    {
      "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/operandLeft": [
        {
          "@value": "https://w3id.org/starwars/v0.0.1/ns/faction"
        }
      ],
      "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/operator": [
        {
          "@value": "="
        }
      ],
      "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/operandRight": [
        {
          "@value": "Galactic Imperium"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## 2. Policies

Policies are the EDC way of expressing that certain conditions may, must or must not be satisfied in certain situations.
Policies are used to express what requirements a subject (e.g. a communication partner) must fulfill in
order to be able to perform an action. For example, that the communication partner must be headquartered in the European
Union.

Policies are [ODRL](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/) serialized as JSON-LD. Thus, our previous example would look like
this:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/"
  },
  "@type": "PolicyDefinition",
  "policy": {
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Set",
    "duty": [
      {
        "target": "http://example.com/asset:12345",
        "action": "use",
        "constraint": {
          "leftOperand": "headquarter_location",
          "operator": "eq",
          "rightOperand": "EU"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `duty` object expresses the semantics of the constraint. It is a specialization of `rule`, which expresses either a
MUST (`duty`), MAY (`permission`) or MUST NOT (`prohibition`) relation. The `action` expresses the type of action for
which the rule is intended. Acceptable values for `action` are defined [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#action),
but in EDC you'll exclusively encounter `"use"`.

The `constraint` object expresses logical relationship of a key (`leftOperand`), the value (`righOperand`) and the
`operator`. Multiple constraints can be linked with logical operators, see [advanced policy
concepts](#25-advanced-policy-concepts). The `leftOperand` and `rightOperand` are completely arbitrary, only the
`operator` is limited to the following possible values: `eq`, `neq`, `gt`, `geq`, `lt`, `leq`, `in`, `hasPart`, `isA`,
`isAllOf`, `isAnyOf`, `isNoneOf`.

Please note that not all operators are always allowed, for example `headquarter_location lt EU` is nonsensical and
should result in an evaluation error, whereas `headquarter_location isAnOf [EU, US]` would be valid. Whether an
`operator` is valid is solely defined by the [policy evaluation function](#23-policy-evaluation-functions), supplying
an invalid operator should raise an exception.

### 2.1 Policy vs PolicyDefinition

In EDC we have two general use cases under which we handle and persist policies:

1. for use in contract definitions
2. during contract negotiations

In the first case policies are ODRL objects and thus must have a `uid` property. They are typically used in contract
definitions.

> Side note: the ODRL context available at `http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld` simply defines `uid` as an alias to the
> `@id` property. This means, whether we use `uid` or `@id` doesn't matter, both expand to the same property `@id`.

However in the second case we are dealing with DCAT objects, that have no concept of Offers, Policies or Assets. Rather,
their vocabulary includes Datasets, Dataservices etc. So when deserializing those DCAT objects there is no way to
reconstruct `Policy#uid`, because the JSON-LD structure does not contain it.

To account for this, we defined the `Policy` class as value object that contains rules and other properties. In
addition, we have a `PolicyDefinition` class, which contains a `Policy` and an `id` property, which makes it an
_entity_.

### 2.2 Policy scopes and bindings

A policy scope is the "situation", in which a policy is evaluated. For example, a policy may need to be evaluated when a
contract negotiation is attempted. To do that, EDC defines certain points in the code called "scopes" to which policies
are _bound_. These policy scopes (sometimes called policy evaluation points) are static, injecting/adding additional
scopes is not possible. Currently, the following scopes are defined:

- `contract.negotiation`: evaluated upon initial contract offer. Ensures that the consumer fulfills the contract policy.
- `transfer.process`: evaluated before starting a transfer process to ensure that the policy of the [contract
  agreement](#5-contract-agreements) is fulfilled. One example would be contract expiry.
- `catalog`: evaluated when the catalog for a particular participant agent is generated. Decides whether the participant
  has the asset in their catalog.
- `request.contract.negotiation`: evaluated on every request during contract negotiation between two control plane
  runtimes. Not relevant for end users.
- `request.transfer.process`: evaluated on every request during transfer establishment between two control plane
  runtimes. Not relevant for end users.
- `request.catalog`: evaluated upon an incoming catalog request. Not relevant for end users.
- `provision.manifest.verify`: evaluated during the precondition check for resource provisioning. Only relevant in
  advanced use cases.

A policy scope is a string that is used for two purposes:

1. binding a scope to a rule type: implement filtering based on the `action` or the `leftOperand` of a policy. This
   determines for every rule inside a policy whether it should be evaluated in the given scope. In other words, it
   determines _if_ a rule should be evaluated.
2. binding a [policy evaluation function](#23-policy-evaluation-functions) to a scope: if a policy is determined to be
   "in scope" by the previous step, the policy engine invokes the evaluation function that was bound to the scope to
   evaluate if the policy is fulfilled. In other words, it determines (implements) _how_ a rule should be evaluated.

### 2.3 Policy evaluation functions

If policies are a formalized declaration of requirements, policy evaluation functions are the means to evaluate those
requirements. They are pieces of Java code executed at runtime. A policy on its own only _expresses_ the requirement,
but in order to enforce it, we need to run policy evaluation functions.

Upon evaluation, they receive the operator, the `rightOperand` (or _rightValue_), the rule, and the `PolicyContext`. A
simple evaluation function that asserts the headquarters policy mentioned in the example above could look similar to
this:

```java
import org.eclipse.edc.policy.engine.spi.AtomicConstraintFunction;

public class HeadquarterFunction implements AtomicConstraintFunction<Duty> {
    public boolean evaluate(Operator operator, Object rightValue, Permission rule, PolicyContext context) {
        if (!(rightValue instanceof String)) {
            context.reportProblem("Right-value expected to be String but was " + rightValue.getClass());
            return false;
        }
        if (operator != Operator.EQ) {
            context.reportProblem("Invalid operator, only EQ is allowed!");
            return false;
        }

        var participant = context.getContextData(ParticipantAgent.class);
        var participantLocation = extractLocationClaim(participant); // EU, US, etc.
        return participantLocation != null && rightValue.equalsIgnoreCase(participantLocation);
    }
}
```

This particular evaluation function only accepts `eq` as operator, and only accepts scalars as `rightValue`, no list
types.

The `ParticipantAgent` is a representation of the communication counterparty that contains a set of verified claims. In
the example, `extractLocationClaim()` would look for a claim that contains the location of the agent and return it as
string. This can get quite complex, for example, the claim could contain geo-coordinates, and the evaluation function
would have to perform inverse address geocoding.

Other policies may require other context data than the participant's location, for example an exact timestamp, or may
even need a lookup in some third party system such as a customer database.

The same policy can be evaluated by different evaluation functions, if they are meaningful in different contexts
([scopes](#22-policy-scopes-and-bindings)).

> NB: to write evaluation code for policies, implement the `org.eclipse.edc.policy.engine.spi.AtomicConstraintFunction`
> interface. There is a second interface with the same name, but that is only used for internal use in the
> `PolicyEvaluationEngine`.

### 2.4 Example: binding an evaluation function

As we've learned, for a policy to be evaluated at certain [points](#22-policy-scopes-and-bindings), we need to create
a policy (duh!), bind the policy to a scope, create a [policy evaluation function](#23-policy-evaluation-functions),
and we need to bind the function to the same scope. The standard way of registering and binding policies is done in an
[extension](./extension-model.md). For example, here we configure our `HeadquarterFunction` so that it evaluates our
`headquarter_location` function whenever someone tries to negotiate a contract:

```java
public class HeadquarterPolicyExtension implements ServiceExtension {

    @Inject
    private RuleBindingRegistry ruleBindingRegistry;

    @Inject
    private PolicyEngine policyEngine;

    private static final String HEADQUARTER_POLICY_KEY = "headquarter_location";

    @Override
    public void initialize() {
        // bind the policy to the scope
        ruleBindingRegistry.bind(HEADQUARTER_POLICY_KEY, NEGOTIATION_SCOPE);
        // create the function object
        var function = new HeadquarterFunction();
        // bind the function to the scope
        policyEngine.registerFunction(NEGOTIATION_SCOPE, Duty.class, HEADQUARTER_POLICY_KEY, function);
    }
}
```

The code does two things: it _binds_ the function key (= the leftOperand) to the negotiation scope, which means that the
policy is "relevant" in that scope. Further, it binds the evaluation function to the same scope, which means the policy
engine "finds" the function and executes it in the negotiation scope.

This example assumes, a policy object exists in the system, that has a `leftOperand = headquarter_location`. For details
on how to create policies, please check out the [OpenAPI
documentation](https://eclipse-edc.github.io/Connector/openapi/management-api/#/Policy%20Definition/createPolicyDefinition).

### 2.5 Advanced policy concepts

###### Pre- and Post-Evaluators

Pre- and post-validators are functions that are executed before and after the actual policy evaluation, respectively.
They can be used to perform preliminary evaluation of a policy or to enrich the `PolicyContext`. For example, EDC uses
pre-validators to inject DCP scope strings using dedicated `ScopeExtractor` objects.

###### Dynamic functions

These are very similar to `AtomicConstraintFunctions`, with one significant difference: they also receive the
left-operand as function parameter. This is useful when the function cannot be bound to a left-operand of a policy,
because the left-operand is not known in advance.

Let's revisit our headquarter policy from earlier and change it a little:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/"
  },
  "@type": "PolicyDefinition",
  "policy": {
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "Set",
    "duty": [
      {
        "target": "http://example.com/asset:12345",
        "action": "use",
        "constraint": {
          "or": [
            {
              "leftOperand": "headquarter.location",
              "operator": "eq",
              "rightOperand": "EU"
            },
            {
              "leftOperand": "headerquarter.numEmployees",
              "operator": "gt",
              "rightOperand": 5000
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This means two things. One, our policy has changed its semantics: now we require the headquarter to be in the EU, or to
have more than 5000 employees.

## 3. Contract definitions

Contract definitions are how [assets](#1-assets) and [policies](#2-policies) are linked together. It is EDC's way of
expressing which policies are in effect for an asset. So when an asset (or several assets) are offered in the dataspace,
a contract definition is used to express under what conditions they are offered. Those conditions are comprised of a
_contract policy_ and an _access policy_. The _access policy_ determines, whether a participant will even get the offer,
and the contract policy determines whether they can negotiate a contract for it. Those policies are referenced by ID,
but foreign-key constrainta are not enforced. This means that contract definitions can be created _ahead of time_.

It is important to note that contract definitions are _implementation details_ (i.e. _internal objects_), which means
they **never** leave the realm of the provider, and they are **never** sent to the consumer via DSP.

- **access policy**: determines whether a particular consumer is offered an asset when making a catalog request. For
  example, we may want to restrict certain assets such that only consumers within a particular geography can see them.
  Consumers outside that geography wouldn't even have them in their catalog.
- **contract policy**: determines the conditions for initiating a contract negotiation for a particular asset. Note that
  this only guarantees the successful _initiation_ of a contract negotiation, it does not automatically guarantee the
  successful _conclusion_ of it!

Contract definitions also contain an `assetsSelector`. THat is a query expression that defines all the assets that are
included in the definition, like an SQL `SELECT` statement. With that it is possible to configure the same set of
conditions (= access policy and contract policy) for a multitude of assets.

Please note that creating an `assetSelector` may require knowledge about the shape of an Asset and can get complex
fairly quickly, so be sure to read the chapter about [querying](#9-querying-with-queryspec-and-criterion).

Here is an example of a contract definition, that defines an access policy and a contract policy for assets `id1`, `id2`
and `id3` that must contain the `"foo" : "bar"` property.

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/"
  },
  "@type": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/ContractDefinition",
  "@id": "test-id",
  "edc:accessPolicyId": "access-policy-1234",
  "edc:contractPolicyId": "contract-policy-5678",
  "edc:assetsSelector": [
    {
      "@type": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/Criterion",
      "edc:operandLeft": "id",
      "edc:operator": "in",
      "edc:operandRight": [
        "id1",
        "id2",
        "id3"
      ]
    },
    {
      "@type": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/Criterion",
      "edc:operandLeft": "foo",
      "edc:operator": "=",
      "edc:operandRight": "bar"
    }
  ]
}
```

The sample expresses that a set of assets identified by their ID be made available under the access policy
`access-policy-1234` and contract policy `contract-policy-5678`, if they contain a property `"foo" : "bar"`.

> Note that asset selector expressions are always logically conjoined using an "AND" operation.

## 4. Contract negotiations

If a connector fulfills the [contract policy](#3-contract-definitions), it may initiate the negotiation of a contract
for
a particular asset. During that negotiation, both parties can send offers and counter-offers that can contain altered
terms (= policy) as any human would in a negotiation, and the counter-party may accept or reject them.

Contract negotiations have a few key aspects:

- they target _one_ asset
- they take place between a _provider_ and a _consumer_ connector
- they cannot be changed by the user directly
- users can only decline, terminate or cancel them

As a side note it is also important to note that contract offers are _ephemeral_ objects as they are generated
on-the-fly for a particular participant, and they are never persisted in a database and thus cannot be queried through
any API.

Contract negotiations are asynchronous in nature. That means after initiating them, they become (potentially
long-running) stateful processes that are advanced by an
internal [state machine](./programming-primitives.md#1-state-machines).
The current state of the negotiation can be queried and altered through the management API.

Here's a diagram of the state machine applied to contract negotiations:

![Contract Negotiation State Machine](../diagrams/contract-negotiation-states.png)

A contract negotiation can be initiated from the consumer side by sending a `ContractRequest` to the connector
management API.

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/"
  },
  "@type": "ContractRequest",
  "counterPartyAddress": "http://provider-address",
  "protocol": "dataspace-protocol-http",
  "policy": {
    "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",
    "@type": "odrl:Offer",
    "@id": "offer-id",
    "assigner": "providerId",
    "permission": [],
    "prohibition": [],
    "obligation": [],
    "target": "assetId"
  },
  "callbackAddresses": [
    {
      "transactional": false,
      "uri": "http://callback/url",
      "events": [
        "contract.negotiation"
      ],
      "authKey": "auth-key",
      "authCodeId": "auth-code-id"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `counterPartyAddress` is the address where to send the `ContractRequestMessage` via the specified `protocol` (
currently [`dataspace-protocol-http`](../contributor-handbook.md#28-protocol-extensions-dsp))

The `policy` should hold the same policy associated to the data offering chosen from the [catalog](#6-catalog), plus
two additional properties:

- `assigner` the providers `participantId`
- `target` the asset (dataset) ID

In addition, the (optional) `callbackAddresses` array can be used to get notified about state changes of the
negotiation. Read more on callbacks in the section
about [events and callbacks](./service-layers.md#6-events-and-callbacks).

> Note: if the `policy` sent by the consumer differs from the one expressed by the provider, the contract negotiation
> will fail and transition to a `TERMINATED` state.

## 5. Contract agreements

Once a contract negotiation is successfully concluded (i.e. it reaches the `FINALIZED` state), it "turns into" a
contract agreement. It is always the provider connector that gives the final approval. Contract agreements are
immutable objects that contain the final, agreed-on policy, the ID of the asset that the contract was negotiated for,
the IDs of the negotiation parties and the exact signing date.

> Note that in future iterations contracts will be cryptographically signed to further support the need for
> immutability and non-repudiation.

Like contract definitions, contract agreements are entities that only exist within the bounds of a connector.

_About terminating contracts:_ once a contract negotiation has reached a [terminal
state](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/v/dataspace-protocol/contract-negotiation/contract.negotiation.protocol#id-1.2-state-machine)
`TERMINATED` or `FINALIZED`, it becomes immutable. This could be compared to not being able to scratch a signature off a
physical paper contract. Cancelling or terminating a contract is therefor handled through other channels like eventing
systems. The semantics of cancelling a contract are highly individual to each dataspace and may even bring legal side
effects, so EDC cannot make an assumption here.

## 6. Catalog

The catalog contains the "data offerings" of a connector and one or multiple service endpoints to initiate a negotiation
for those offerings.

Every data offering is represented by a [`Dataset` object](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/#Class:Dataset) which
contains a [policy](#2-policies) and one or multiple [`Distribution`
objects](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/#Class:Distribution). A `Distribution` should be understood as a _variant_
or _representation_ of the `Dataset`. For instance, if a file is accessible via multiple transmission channels from a
provider (HTTP and FTP), then each of those channels would be represented as a `Distribution`. Another example would be
image assets that are available in different file formats (PNG, TIFF, JPEG).

A [`DataService` object](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-2/#Class:Data_Service) specifies the endpoint where contract
negotiations and transfers are accepted by the provider. In practice, this will be the DSP endpoint of the connector.

The following example shows an HTTP response to a catalog request, that contains one offer that is available via two
channels `HttpData-PUSH` and `HttpData-PULL`.

Catalogs are ephemeral objects, they are not persisted or cached on the provider side. Everytime a consumer participant
makes a catalog request through DSP, the connector runtime has to evaluate the incoming request and build up the catalog
specifically for that participant. The reason for this is that between two subsequent requests from the same
participant, the contract definition or the claims or the participant could have changed.

The relevant component in EDC is the `DatasetResolver`, which resolves all contract definitions that are relevant to a
participant filtering out those where the participant does not satisfy the access policy and collects all the assets
therein.

In order to determine how an asset can be _distributed_, the resolver requires knowledge about the data planes that are
available. It uses the [Dataplane Signaling Protocol](../contributor-handbook.md#210-data-plane-signaling) to query them
and construct the list of
`Distributions` for an asset.

## 7 Transfer processes

A `TransferProcess` is a record of the data sharing procedure between a _consumer_ and a _provider_. As they traverse
through the system, they transition through several
states ([`TransferProcessStates`](./programming-primitives.md#1-state-machines)).

Once a contract is [negotiated](#4-contract-negotiations) and an [agreement](#5-contract-agreements) is reached, the
consumer connector may send a transfer initiate request to start the transfer. In the course of doing that, both parties
may provision additional resources, for example deploying a
temporary object store, where the provider should put the data. Similarly, the provider may need to take some
preparatory steps, e.g. anonymizing the data before sending it out.

This is sometimes referred to as the _provisioning phase_. If no additional provisioning is needed, the transfer process
simply transitions through the state with a NOOP.

Once that is done, the transfer begins in earnest. Data is transmitted according to the `dataDestination`, that was
passed in the initiate-request.

Once the transmission has completed, the transfer process will transition to the `COMPLETED` state, or - if an error
occurred - to the `TERMINATED` state.

The Management API provides several endpoints to manipulate data transfers.

Here is a diagram of the state machine applied to transfer processes on consumer side:

![Transfer Process Consumer State Machine](../diagrams/transfer-process-consumer-states.png)

Here is a diagram of the state machine applied to transfer processes on provider side:

![Transfer Process Provider State Machine](../diagrams/transfer-process-provider-states.png)

A transfer process can be initiated from the consumer side by sending a `TransferRequest` to the connector Management
API:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/"
  },
  "@type": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/TransferRequest",
  "protocol": "dataspace-protocol-http",
  "counterPartyAddress": "http://provider-address",
  "contractId": "contract-id",
  "transferType": "transferType",
  "dataDestination": {
    "type": "data-destination-type"
  },
  "privateProperties": {
    "private-key": "private-value"
  },
  "callbackAddresses": [
    {
      "transactional": false,
      "uri": "http://callback/url",
      "events": [
        "contract.negotiation",
        "transfer.process"
      ],
      "authKey": "auth-key",
      "authCodeId": "auth-code-id"
    }
  ]
}
```

where:

- `counterPartyAddress`: the address where to send the `TransferRequestMessage` via the specified `protocol` (
  currently [`dataspace-protocol-http`](../contributor-handbook.md#28-protocol-extensions-dsp))
- `contractId`: the ID of a previously negotiated [contract agreement](#5-contract-agreements) which is a result of
  the [contract negotiation](#4-contract-negotiations) process.
- [`transferType`](#71-transfer-and-data-flows-types) and the [`dataDestination`](#72-about-data-destinations)define
  how and where the data transfer should happen.
- [`callbackAddresses`](#73-transfer-process-callbacks) custom hooks in order bo be notified about state transition of
  the transfer process.
- `privateProperties`: custom properties not shared with the counter party.

### 7.1 Transfer and data flows types

The transfer type defines the channel (Distribution) for the data transfer and it depends on the capabilities of
the [data plane](../contributor-handbook.md#3-the-data-plane) if it can be fulfilled. The `transferType` available for a
data offering is available in the `dct:format` of the `Distribution` when inspecting the [catalog](#6-catalog) response.

Each transfer type also characterizes the type of the flow, which can be either [pull](#711-consumer-pull)
or [push](#712-provider-push) and it's data can be either [finite](#712-finite-and-non-finite-data)
or [non-finite](#712-finite-and-non-finite-data)

#### 7.1.1 Consumer Pull

A pull transfer is when the consumer receives information (in the form of a `DataAddress`) on how to retrieve data from
the Provider.
Then it's up to the consumer to use this information for pulling the data.

![Consumer Pull](../diagrams/transfer-data-plane-consumer-pull.png)

**Provider and consumer agree to a contract (not displayed in the diagram)**

1. Consumer initiates the transfer process by sending a [
   `TransferRequestMessage`](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/v/dataspace-protocol/transfer-process/transfer.process.protocol#21-transfer-request-message)
2. The Provider Control Plane retrieves the `DataAddress` of the actual data source and creates a`DataFlowStartMessage`.
3. The Provider Control Plane asks the selector which Data Plane instance can be used for this data transfer
4. The Selector returns an eligible Data Plane instance (if any)
5. Provider Control Plane sends the `DataFlowStartMessage` to the selected Data Plane instance
   through [data plane signaling](../contributor-handbook.md#210-data-plane-signaling) protocol.
6. The Provider `DataPlaneManager` validates the incoming request and delegates to the `DataPlaneAuthorizationService`
   the generation of `DataAddress`, containing the information on location and authorization for fetching the data
7. The Provider Data Plane acknowledges the Provider control plane and attach the `DataAddress` generated.
8. The Provider Control Plane notifies the start of the transfer attaching the `DataAddress` in the [
   `TransferStartMessage`](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/v/dataspace-protocol/transfer-process/transfer.process.protocol#22-transfer-start-message).
9. The Consumer Control plane receives the `DataAddress` and dispatch it accordingly to the configured runtime. Consumer
   can either decide to receive the `DataAddress` using the eventing
   system [callbacks](#73-transfer-process-callbacks) using the `transfer.process.started` type, or use
   the [EDRs](#8-endpoint-data-references) extensions for automatically store it on consumer control plane side.
10. With the informations in the `DataAddress` such as the `endpointUrl` and the `Authorization` data can be fetched.
11. The Provider Data plane validates and authenticates the incoming request and retrieves the source `DataAddress`.
12. The he provider data plane proxies the validated request to the configured backend in the source `DataAddress`.

#### 7.1.2 Provider Push

A push transfer is when the Provider data plane initiates sending data to the destination specified by the consumer.

![Provider Push](../diagrams/transfer-data-plane-provider-push.png)

**Provider and consumer agree to a contract (not displayed in the diagram)**

1. The Consumer initiates the transfer process, i.e. sends [
   `TransferRequestMessage`](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/v/dataspace-protocol/transfer-process/transfer.process.protocol#21-transfer-request-message)
   with a destination [DataAddress](#72-about-data-destinations)
2. The Provider Control Plane retrieves the `DataAddress` of the actual data source and creates a `DataFlowStartMessage`
   with both source and destination `DataAddress`.
3. The Provider Control Plane asks the selector which Data Plane instance can be used for this data transfer
4. The Selector returns an eligible Data Plane instance (if any)
5. The Provider Control Plane sends the `DataFlowStartMessage` to the selected Data Plane instance
   through [data plane signaling](../contributor-handbook.md#210-data-plane-signaling) protocol.
6. The Provider Data Plane validates the incoming request
7. If request is valid, the Provider Data Plane returns acknowledgement
8. The `DataPlaneManager` of the the Provider Data Plane processes the request: it creates a `DataSource`/`DataSink`pair
   based on the source/destination data addresses
9. The Provider Data Plane fetches data from the actual data source (see `DataSource`)
10. The Provider Data Plane pushes data to the consumer services (see `DataSink`)

#### 7.1.2 Finite and Non-Finite Data

The charaterization of the data applies to either `push` and `pull` transfers. Finite data transfers cause the transfer
process to transitition to the state `COMPLETED`, once the transmission has finished. For example a transfer of a single
file that is hosted and transferred into a cloud storage system.

Non-finite data means that once the transfer process request has been accepted by the provider the transfer process is
in the `STARTED` state until it gets terminated by the consumer or the provider. Exampes of Non-finite data are streams
or API endpoins.

On the provider side transfer processes can also be terminated by
the [policy monitor](../contributor-handbook.md#27-policy-monitor) that
periodically watches over the on going transfer and checks if the
associated [contract agreement](#5-contract-agreements) still fulfills the contract [policy](#2-policies).

### 7.2 About Data Destinations

A data destination is a description of where the consumer expects to find the data after the transfer completes. In a "
provider-push" scenario this could be an object storage container, a directory on a file system, etc. In a
"consumer-pull" scenario this would be a placeholder, that does not contain any information about the destination, as
the provider "decides" which endpoint he makes the data available on.

A data address is a schemaless object, and the provider and the consumer need to have a common understanding of the
required fields. For example, if the provider is supposed to put the data into a file share, the `DataAddress` object
representing the data destination will likely contain the host URL, a path and possibly a file name. So both connectors
need to be "aware" of that.

The actual data transfer is handled by a [data plane](../contributor-handbook.md#3-the-data-plane) through extensions (
called "sources" and "
sinks"). Thus, the way to establish that "understanding" is to make sure that both parties have matching sources and
sinks. That means, if a consumer asks to put the data in a file share, the provider must have the appropriate data plane
extensions to be able to perform that transfer.

If the provider connector does _not_ have the appropriate extensions loaded at runtime, the transfer process will fail.

### 7.3 Transfer process callbacks

In order to get timely updates about status changes of a transfer process, we could simply poll the management API by
firing a `GET /v*/transferprocesses/{tp-id}/state` request every X amount of time. That will not only put unnecessary
load on the connector,
you may also run into rate-limiting situations, if the connector is behind a load balancer of some sort. Thus, we
recommend using event callbacks.

Callbacks must be specified when requesting to initiate the transfer:

```json
{
  // ...
  "callbackAddresses": [
    {
      "transactional": false,
      "uri": "http://callback/url",
      "events": [
        "transfer.process"
      ],
      "authKey": "auth-key",
      "authCodeId": "auth-code-id"
    }
  ]
  //...
}
```

Currently, we support the following events:

- `transfer.process.deprovisioned`
- `transfer.process.completed`
- `transfer.process.deprovisioningRequested`
- `transfer.process.initiated`
- `transfer.process.provisioned`
- `transfer.process.provisioning`
- `transfer.process.requested`
- `transfer.process.started`
- `transfer.process.terminated`

The connector's event dispatcher will send invoke the webhook specified in the `uri` field passing the event
payload as JSON object.

More info about events and callbacks can be found [here](./service-layers.md#6-events-and-callbacks).

## 8 Endpoint Data References

## 9 Querying with `QuerySpec` and `Criterion`

Most of the entities can be queried with the `QuerySpec` object, which is a generic way of expressing limit, offset,
sort and filters when querying a collection of objects managed by the EDC stores.

Here's an example of how a `QuerySpec` object might look like when querying for Assets via management APIs:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "edc": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/"
  },
  "@type": "QuerySpec",
  "limit": 1,
  "offset": 1,
  "sortField": "createdAt",
  "sortOrder": "DESC",
  "filterExpression": [
    {
      "operandLeft": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/description",
      "operator": "=",
      "operandRight": "This asset"
    }
  ]
}
```

which filters by the `description` custom property being equals to `This asset`. The query also paginates the result
with limit and p set to 1. Additionally a sorting strategy is in place by `createdAt` property in `descending` order (
the default is `ASC`)

> Note: Since custom properties are persisted in their [expanded form](./json-ld.md), we have to use
> the expanded form also when querying.

The `filterExpression` property is a list of `Criterion`, which expresses a single filtering condition based on:

- `operandLeft`: the property to filter on
- `operator`: the operator to apply e.g. `=`
- `operandRight`: the value of the filtering

The supported operators are:

- Equal: `=`
- Not equal: `!=`
- In: `in`
- Like: `like`
- Ilike: `ilike` (same as `like` but ignoring case sensitive)
- Contains: `contains`

> Note: multiple filtering expressions are always logically conjoined using an "AND" operation.

The properties that can be expressed in the `operandLeft` of a `Criterion` depend on the shape of the entity that we are
want to query.

> Note: nested properties are also supported using the dot notation.

`QuerySpec` can also be used when doing the catalog request using the `querySpec` property in the catalog request
payload for filtering the datasets:

```json
{
  "@context": {
    "@vocab": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/"
  },
  "counterPartyAddress": "http://provider/api/dsp",
  "protocol": "dataspace-protocol-http",
  "counterPartyId": "providerId",
  "querySpec": {
    "filterExpression": [
      {
        "operandLeft": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/description",
        "operator": "=",
        "operandRight": "This asset"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Entities are backed by [stores](./service-layers.md#51-in-memory-stores) for doing CRUD operations. For each entity
there is an associated store interface (SPI). Most of the stores SPI have a `query` like method which takes a
`QuerySpec` type as input and returns the matched entities in a collection. Indivitual implementations are then
responsible for translating the `QuerySpec` to a proper fetching strategy.

The description on how the translation and mapping works will be explained in each implementation. Currently EDC support
out of the box:

- [In-memory stores](./service-layers.md#51-in-memory-stores) (default implementation).
- [SQL stores](../contributor-handbook.md#29-postgre-sql-persistence) provied as extensions for each store, mostly
  tailored for and tested with
  PostgreSQL.

For guaranteeing the highest compatibility between store implementations, a base tests suite is provided for each store
that each technology implementors need to fulfill in order to have a minimum usable store implementation.
