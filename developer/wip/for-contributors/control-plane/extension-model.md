## 1. Extension basics

Three things are needed to register an extension module with the EDC runtime:

1. a class that implements `ServiceExtension`
2. a [provider-configuration file](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)
3. adding the module to your runtime's build file. EDC uses Gradle, so your runtime build file should contain

```groovy
runtimeOnly(project(":module:path:of:your:extension"))
```

Extensions should **not** contain business logic or application code. Their main job is to

- read and handle [configuration](./extension-model.md#3-configuration-and-best-practices)
- instantiate and register services with the service context (read more [here](./dependency-injection.md))
- allocate and free resources, for example scheduled tasks

## 2. Autodoc and Metamodel Annotations

EDC can automatically generate documentation about its extensions, about the settings used therein and about its
extension points. This feature is available as Gradle task:

```bash
./gardlew autodoc
```

Upon execution, this task generates a JSON file located at `build/edc.json`, which contains structural information about
the extension, for example:

<details>
  <summary>Autodoc output in edc.json</summary>

```json
[
  {
    "categories": [],
    "extensions": [
      {
        "categories": [],
        "provides": [
          {
            "service": "org.eclipse.edc.web.spi.WebService"
          },
          {
            "service": "org.eclipse.edc.web.spi.validation.InterceptorFunctionRegistry"
          }
        ],
        "references": [
          {
            "service": "org.eclipse.edc.web.spi.WebServer",
            "required": true
          },
          {
            "service": "org.eclipse.edc.spi.types.TypeManager",
            "required": true
          }
        ],
        "configuration": [
          {
            "key": "edc.web.rest.cors.methods",
            "required": false,
            "type": "string",
            "description": "",
            "defaultValue": "",
            "deprecated": false
          }
          // other settings
        ],
        "name": "JerseyExtension",
        "type": "extension",
        "overview": null,
        "className": "org.eclipse.edc.web.jersey.JerseyExtension"
      }
    ],
    "extensionPoints": [],
    "modulePath": "org.eclipse.edc:jersey-core",
    "version": "0.8.2-SNAPSHOT",
    "name": null
  }
]
```

</details>

To achieve this, the [EDC Runtime Metamodel](https://github.com/eclipse-edc/Runtime-Metamodel) defines several
annotations. These are not required for compilation, but they should be added to the appropriate classes and fields with
proper attributes to enable good documentation.

Note that `@Provider`, `@Inject`, `@Provides` and `@Requires` are used by Autodoc to resolve the dependency graph for
documentation, but they are also used by the runtime to resolve service dependencies. Read more about that
[here](./dependency-injection.md).

## 3. Configuration and best practices

One important task of extensions is to read and handle configuration. For this, the `ServiceExtensionContext` interface
provides the `getConfig()` group of methods.

Configuration values can be _optional_, i.e. they have a default value, or they can be _mandatory_, i.e. no default
value. Attempting to resolve a mandatory configuration value that was not specified will raise an `EdcException`.

EDC's configuration API can resolve configuration from three places, in this order:

1. from a `ConfigurationExtension`: this is a special extension class that provides a `Config` object. EDC ships with a
   file-system based config extension.
2. from environment variables: `edc.someconfig.someval` would map to `EDC_SOMECONFIG_SOMEVAL`
3. from Java `Properties`: can be passed in through CLI arguments, e.g. `-Dedc.someconfig.someval=...`

Best practices when handling configuration:

- resolve early, fail fast: configuration values should be resolved and validated as early as possible in the
  extension's `initialize()` method.
- don't pass the context: it is a code smell if the `ServiceExtensionContext` is passed into a service to resolve config
- annotate: every setting should have a `@Setting` annotation
- no magic defaults: default values should be declard as constants in the extension class and documented in the
  `@Setting` annotation.
- no secrets: configuration is the wrong place to store secrets
- naming convention: every config value should start with `edc.`
